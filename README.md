# SynthVerse 🎶  
An experimental AI-driven music generator built with Python and deep learning.  

SynthVerse composes original instrumental tracks using transformer-based models trained on MIDI datasets.  
This project was started as an open research experiment by **Myroslav Abdeljawwad** to explore how artificial intelligence can assist in creative sound design.
